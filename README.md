# Chair We GO! - Premium Event Rentals Web Application
Business Overview
* **Business Name:** Chair We GO!
* **Business Description:** Chair We GO! is a premier event rental service provider specializing in high-quality seating (monoblock chairs with optional fitted covers) and banquet/buffet tables. 
* **Target Users:** 
  * **Clients / Event Organizers:** Individuals or planners looking to reserve seating and tables for weddings, parties, corporate events, or private gatherings.
  * **Administrators:** Business owners/managers who oversee inventory capacities, track bookings on a live calendar, review client records, update payment statuses, and provide customer support.

Problem Being Solved
Traditional event equipment rentals often rely on manual spreadsheets, phone calls, or disjointed messaging apps to handle reservations, leading to double-booking errors, stock discrepancies, and delayed payment verifications. **Chair We GO!** solves this by providing an automated, real-time cloud concierge portal that locks inventory capacities instantly, prevents scheduling conflicts, calculates logistics (pick-up vs. delivery) dynamically, and unifies client-admin communication with image attachment support for proof-of-payment verification.
